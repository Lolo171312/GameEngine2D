# GameEngine2D
My own Game Engine I made using C++ during MasterÂ´s Degree used for 2D games.

In this project, I have created a 2D game engine for video games. This engine includes its own Vector2D library to simplify vector calculations. It allows loading textures, animating sprites, checking collisions (using sphere, square, or pixel-perfect sprite collision detection), creating a game background (with multiple layers moving at different speeds and repositioning themselves to simulate an infinite background), and exporting maps (in this case, I created a map using Tiled, a program that exports the map into a .txt file, which can then be read and translated into the game itself).

The LiteGfx library, which greatly simplifies various OpenGL functions, was not created by me but was provided as a resource during the master's degree where I developed this engine.
